# AFKVisualizer

A small Minecraft plugin that shows when players are AFK using gentle floating particles.

It doesn’t try to do everything — no stats, no databases, no toggles.  
Just movement-based detection, a few quiet visuals, and a little care.

I made this as a way to learn, to have fun, and maybe to make someone’s server a tiny bit nicer.  
If it helps, or inspires, or simply works — that’s more than enough for me.

You’re welcome to build on it, suggest changes, or just use it as is.  
Thanks for stopping by. ❤️

To you, for being curious.  
And to the open-source community, for making it possible to build things like this in the first place.

Built with care —  
not because the world needs another plugin,  
but because sometimes the small things matter too.
