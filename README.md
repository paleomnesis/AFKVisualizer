# AFKVisualizer

A small Minecraft plugin that shows when players are AFK using gentle floating particles.

It doesn't aim to be the biggest or most feature-packed.  
Just something quiet, purposeful — and hopefully useful.

I wrote this to learn a little more, to share a little something, and to remind myself that small ideas are still worth building.  
If it brings a moment of clarity to a player, or makes a server feel a bit more alive, then I'm happy.

You're more than welcome to use it, change it, or ignore it completely.  
In any case — thanks for stopping by.

To you, for being curious.  
And to the open-source community, for making space for small voices.

Built with care —  
not because the world needs another plugin,  
but because this one felt worth making anyway.
